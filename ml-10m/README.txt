                                    Summary

   This data set contains 10000054 ratings and 95580 tags applied to 10681
   movies by 71567 users of the online movie recommender service
   [1]MovieLens.

   Users were selected at random for inclusion. All users selected had
   rated at least 20 movies. Unlike previous MovieLens data sets, no
   demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id,
   and no other information is provided.

   The data are contained in three files, movies.dat, ratings.dat and
   tags.dat. Also included are scripts for generating subsets of the data
   to support five-fold cross-validation of rating predictions. More
   details about the contents and use of all these files [2]follows.

   This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download
   at [3]GroupLens Data Sets.

                      Further Information About GroupLens

   [5]GroupLens is a research group in the [6]Department of Computer
   Science and Engineering at the [7]University of Minnesota. Since its
   inception in 1992, GroupLens' research projects have explored a variety
   of fields including:
     * Information Filtering
     * Recommender Systems
     * Online Communities
     * Mobile and Ubiquitious Technologies
     * Digital Libraries
     * Local Geographic Information Systems.

   GroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative
   filtering, [8]MovieLens, which is the source of these data.

                            Content and Use of Files

Character Encoding

   The three data files are encoded as [9]UTF-8. This is a departure from
   previous MovieLens data sets, which used different character encodings.
   If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√©rables,
   Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the
   data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for
   UTF-8.

User Ids

   Movielens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have
   been anonymized.

   Users were selected separately for inclusion in the ratings and tags
   data sets, which implies that user ids may appear in one set but not
   the other.

   The anonymized values are consistent between the ratings and tags data
   files. That is, user id n, if it appears in both files, refers to the
   same real MovieLens user.

Ratings Data File Structure

   All ratings are contained in the file ratings.dat. Each line of this
   file represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the
   following format:

   UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp

   The lines within this file are ordered first by UserID, then, within
   user, by MovieID.

   Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments.

   [10]Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal
   Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

Tags Data File Structure

   All tags are contained in the file tags.dat. Each line of this file
   represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the
   following format:

   UserID::MovieID::Tag::Timestamp

   The lines within this file are ordered first by UserID, then, within
   user, by MovieID.

   [11]Tags are user generated metadata about movies. Each tag is
   typically a single word, or short phrase. The meaning, value and
   purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.

   [12]Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal
   Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

Movies Data File Structure

   Movie information is contained in the file movies.dat. Each line of
   this file represents one movie, and has the following format:

   MovieID::Title::Genres

   MovieID is the real MovieLens id.

   Movie titles, by policy, should be entered identically to those found
   in [13]IMDB, including year of release. However, they are entered
   manually, so errors and inconsistencies may exist.

   Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:
     * Action
     * Adventure
     * Animation
     * Children's
     * Comedy
     * Crime
     * Documentary
     * Drama
     * Fantasy
     * Film-Noir
     * Horror
     * Musical
     * Mystery
     * Romance
     * Sci-Fi
     * Thriller
     * War
     * Western

Cross-Validation Subset Generation Scripts

   A Unix shell script, split_ratings.sh, is provided that, if desired,
   can be used to split the ratings data for five-fold cross-validation of
   rating predictions. It depends on a second script, allbut.pl, which is
   also included and is written in Perl. They should run without
   modification under Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin or other Unix like systems.

   Running split_ratings.sh will use ratings.dat as input, and produce the
   fourteen output files described below. Multiple runs of the script will
   produce identical results.

   File Names Description
   r1.train, r2.train, r3.train, r4.train, r5.train
   r1.test, r2.test, r3.test, r4.test, r5.test
   The data sets r1.train and r1.test through r5.train and r5.test are
   80%/20% splits of the ratings data into training and test data. Each of
   r1, ..., r5 have disjoint test sets; this if for 5 fold cross
   validation (where you repeat your experiment with each training and
   test set and average the results).
   ra.train, rb.train
   ra.test, rb.test
   The data sets ra.train, ra.test, rb.train, and rb.test split the
   ratings data into a training set and a test set with exactly 10 ratings
   per user in the test set. The sets ra.test and rb.test are disjoint.
