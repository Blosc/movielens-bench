    <h1>
        Summary
    </h1>
    <p>
      This data set contains 10000054 ratings and 95580 tags 
      applied to 10681 movies by 71567 users of the 
      online movie recommender service <a href="http://www.movielens.org">MovieLens</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users were selected at random for inclusion.  All users selected had rated 
      at least 20 movies.  Unlike previous MovieLens data sets, no demographic 
      information is included.  Each user is represented by an id, and no other 
      information is provided.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data are contained in three files, <code>movies.dat</code>, 
      <code>ratings.dat</code> and <code>tags.dat</code>.
      Also included are scripts for generating subsets of the data to support five-fold
      cross-validation of rating predictions.  More details about the contents and use
      of all these files <a href="#file_desc">follows</a>.
    </p>

        Further Information About GroupLens
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.grouplens.org/">GroupLens</a> is a research group in the 
      <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>
      at the <a href="http://www.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a>.  Since its 
      inception in 1992, GroupLens' research projects have explored a variety of fields
      including: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information Filtering</li>
      <li>Recommender Systems</li>
      <li>Online Communities</li>
      <li>Mobile and Ubiquitious Technologies</li>
      <li>Digital Libraries</li>
      <li>Local Geographic Information Systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      GroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on
      collaborative filtering, <a href="http://www.movielens.org/">MovieLens</a>,
      which is the source of these data.

      Content and Use of Files
    </h1>

    <h2>
      Character Encoding
    </h2>
    <p>
      The three data files are encoded as 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf-8">UTF-8</a>.  This is a departure
      from previous MovieLens data sets, which used different character encodings.
      If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√©rables, Les (1995))
      display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a 
      text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.
    </p>

    <h2>
      User Ids
    </h2>
    <p>
      Movielens users were selected at random for inclusion.  Their ids have been 
      anonymized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users were selected separately for inclusion 
      in the ratings and tags data sets, which implies that user ids may appear in 
      one set but not the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anonymized values are consistent between the ratings and tags data files.  
      That is, user id <em>n</em>, if it appears in both files, refers to the same
      real MovieLens user.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ratings Data File Structure
    </h2>
    <p>
      All ratings are contained in the file <code>ratings.dat</code>.  Each line of this 
      file represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:
    </p>
    <p class="file_line_structure">
      <code>UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines within this file are ordered first by UserID, then, within user, 
      by MovieID.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Timestamps</a> represent 
      seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Tags Data File Structure
    </h2>
    <p>
      All tags are contained in the file <code>tags.dat</code>.  Each line of this 
      file represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has 
      the following format:
    </p>
    <p class="file_line_structure">
      <code>UserID::MovieID::Tag::Timestamp</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines within this file are ordered first by UserID, then, within user, 
      by MovieID.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">Tags</a> are user 
      generated metadata about movies.  Each tag is typically a single word, or
      short phrase.  The meaning, value and purpose of a particular tag is 
      determined by each user.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Timestamps</a> represent 
      seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Movies Data File Structure
    </h2>
    <p>
      Movie information is contained in the file <code>movies.dat</code>.  
      Each line of this file represents one movie, and has the following format:
    </p>
    <p class="file_line_structure">
      <code>MovieID::Title::Genres</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      MovieID is the real MovieLens id.
    </p>
    <p>
      Movie titles, by policy, should be entered identically to those
      found in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>, including year of release.
      However, they are entered manually, so errors and inconsistencies may exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Action</li>
	  <li>Adventure</li>
	  <li>Animation</li>
	  <li>Children's</li>
	  <li>Comedy</li>
	  <li>Crime</li>
	  <li>Documentary</li>
	  <li>Drama</li>
	  <li>Fantasy</li>
	  <li>Film-Noir</li>
	  <li>Horror</li>
	  <li>Musical</li>
	  <li>Mystery</li>
	  <li>Romance</li>
	  <li>Sci-Fi</li>
	  <li>Thriller</li>
	  <li>War</li>
	  <li>Western</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Cross-Validation Subset Generation Scripts
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Unix shell script, <code>split_ratings.sh</code>, is provided that, if desired, 
      can be used to split the ratings data for five-fold cross-validation
      of rating predictions.  It depends on a second script, allbut.pl, which 
      is also included and is written in Perl.  They should run without modification
      under Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin or other Unix like systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running <code>split_ratings.sh</code> will use <code>ratings.dat</code>
      as input, and produce the fourteen output files described below.  Multiple
      runs of the script will produce identical results.
    </p>
    <table style="width:75%" border="1">
      <tr>
        <th style="width:25%">File Names</th>
        <th>Description</th>

          r1.test, r2.test, r3.test, r4.test, r5.test<br/>
         </td>
         <td>
           The data sets r1.train and r1.test through r5.train and r5.test
           are 80%/20% splits of the ratings data into training and test data.
           Each of r1, ..., r5 have disjoint test sets; this if for
           5 fold cross validation (where you repeat your experiment
           with each training and test set and average the results).

          ra.train, rb.train<br/>
          ra.test, rb.test<br/>
         </td>
        <td>
          The data sets ra.train, ra.test, rb.train, and rb.test
          split the ratings data into a training set and a test set with
          exactly 10 ratings per user in the test set.  The sets
          ra.test and rb.test are disjoint.
