movielens-bench
===============

Datafiles for the MovieLens dataset for benchmarking purposes.

These are slightly modified versions of the originals so as to
easy the import process. The original MovieLens datasets are over here:
http://www.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens

Many of the benchmarks here are for the bcolz package, and are strongly
based on Greg Redas's previous work:
